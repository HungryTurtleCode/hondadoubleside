# Honda Double Side Effect

This is the repo of the code that was written in the Hungry Turtle Dev youtube video that explained how to create this effect. 

The videos that this repo was created in can be seen here:

- Part 1: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NzKTSLceTc>
- Part 2: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzDXp0ekhZA>

##Part 1
This part of the videos goes into how to actually create some funcitonal code in a way that many beginner JS devs would likely approach it. Producing working code, although the code is not clean and is difficult to read.

##Part 2
This part takes the code from part one and refactors it into something a little more modular and easy to read. 

This is good JS practice and for sure a good habit to get into, especially if you are looking to go further with JS and get into front end frameworks such as Angular or Ember.
